📌 1. Work Items Dashboard & Queries
Created custom work item queries using Boards > Queries for:
Active bugs
Tasks assigned to me
Pinned queries to a shared dashboard for tracking.
⚙️ 2. Pipeline Variables
Used pipeline-level and stage-level variables in YAML.

variables:
  imageName: myapp
  tag: $(Build.BuildId)
steps:
- script: echo "Building $(imageName):$(tag)"
📦 3. Variable & Task Groups
Created variable groups in Library > Variable Groups

Scoped them to specific pipeline stages.

variables:
- group: BuildSecrets

stages:
- stage: Build
  variables:
    - group: BuildSecrets
- stage: Deploy
  variables:
    - group: DeploySecrets
🔐 4. Service Connection
Created Azure Resource Manager and Docker Registry (ACR) service connections from Project Settings > Service Connections

Used them in pipelines to push images and deploy.

🖥️ 5. Self-Hosted Agent
Configured a Linux self-hosted agent with the following:

wget https://vstsagentpackage.azureedge.net/agent/3.225.0/vsts-agent-linux-x64-3.225.0.tar.gz
tar zxvf vsts-agent-linux-x64-3.225.0.tar.gz
./config.sh --url https://dev.azure.com/ORG --auth pat --token YOUR_PAT
./svc.sh install
./svc.sh start
⏱️ 6. Pre & Post Deployment Approvals
Added manual approvers in Release Pipelines

Configured both pre-deployment and post-deployment conditions per environment.

🐳 7. CI/CD: Docker → ACR → AKS

        command: apply
        arguments: -f manifests/deployment.yaml
🚀 8. CI/CD: Docker → ACR → ACI
- task: AzureCLI@2
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'azure-service-connection'
